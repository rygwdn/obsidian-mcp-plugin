# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] - 2025-01-07

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **Self-Contained Server**: Removed dependency on Obsidian Local REST API plugin. The MCP plugin
  now runs its own HTTP/HTTPS server. This greatly simplifies setup and reduces external
  dependencies.
- **Authentication Required**: All API requests now require Bearer token authentication. Create at
  least one token in settings to enable access.
- **HTTP Transport**: Changed MCP transport type from `streamableHttp` to standard `http`. Update
  your MCP client configuration accordingly.
- **SSE Removed**: Server-Sent Events support has been removed in favor of standard HTTP-only
  transport.

### Added

- **Built-in HTTP/HTTPS server with Express**
  - Self-contained server with configurable host and port
  - HTTP mode (default) for simple local setup
  - HTTPS mode (experimental) with self-signed certificates
  - Real-time server status display in settings
  - Deferred startup to minimize Obsidian load time

- **Token-based authentication with granular permissions**
  - Multiple token support with individual configurations
  - Per-token tool enablement (file access, search, content modification, dataview, quickadd)
  - Per-token directory permissions with allow/deny rules
  - Read and Write permission levels
  - Token usage tracking (last used timestamp)
  - Simplified token UI with compact rows and feature icons

- **Certificate management for HTTPS**
  - Automatic self-signed certificate generation
  - Certificate download via temporary HTTP server (30-second window)
  - OS-specific installation instructions (macOS, Windows, Linux)
  - Certificate trust status detection
  - Certificate expiry monitoring
  - Subject Alternative Names support for custom hostnames/IPs

- **Tabbed settings UI**
  - Organized into Tokens, Server, Vault, and Advanced tabs
  - Inline token configuration (no modal required)
  - Copyable token values with one-click copy button
  - Feature icons matching configuration section order
  - Example MCP configurations for each token

### Changed

- HTTPS disabled by default in favor of HTTP for easier setup
- HTTPS marked as experimental with warning indicator
- Settings UI refreshes automatically when toggling HTTPS
- Directory permissions UI no longer jumps when modified
- Token configuration now shown inline instead of modal
- Certificate filename changed to `obsidian-mcp-plugin.pem`
- macOS certificate instructions emphasize System keychain requirement

### Removed

- Dependency on `obsidian-local-rest-api` package (now optional for certificate import only)
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) support
- Connection info section from server tab
