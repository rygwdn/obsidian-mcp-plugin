# Testing Best Practices

Tests should use real implementations instead of mocks whenever possible. The [test/resources.test.ts](mdc:test/resources.test.ts) file serves as a good example of this approach.

Key testing principles:
- Set up test environment with realistic data
- Use MockApp to simulate Obsidian's API
- Avoid vi.mock() for any of the code under test
