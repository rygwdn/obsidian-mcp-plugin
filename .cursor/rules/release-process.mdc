# Release Process

Follow these steps to properly release a new version of the MCP plugin for Obsidian submission:

## Pre-Release Checklist
- Ensure all tests pass: `npm run check`
- Ensure all changes have been committed to the repository
- Review the non-test diff since the last release
- Update [CHANGELOG.md](mdc:CHANGELOG.md) with the new version:
   ```markdown
   ## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD
   - feat: New feature description
   - fix: Bug fix description
   - refactor: Other changes
   ```

## Version Bump
- Update the version number in the package.json
- Run the version bump script to update version references `npm run version`
  This script:
  - Updates the version in [manifest.json](mdc:manifest.json)
  - Updates [versions.json](mdc:versions.json) with the new version
- Run a final check: `npm run check`
- Commit all the changes `git commit -a -m 'release: prepare x.y.z release'`

## Tag and Push
```bash
git tag x.y.z
git push origin x.y.z
```

## GitHub Release
After pushing the tag, GitHub Actions will:
- Create a draft release with notes from the CHANGELOG
- Build the plugin
- Upload the required files as binary attachments to the release:
  - main.js
  - manifest.json
  - styles.css (if used by the plugin)

## IMPORTANT: Obsidian Plugin Requirements
For Obsidian plugin directory submission, the release MUST have:
1. The tag version (x.y.z) MUST exactly match the version in manifest.json
2. The main.js, manifest.json, and styles.css (if applicable) files MUST be uploaded as binary attachments
3. After review, the draft release must be published

## Final Steps
- Wait for GitHub workflows to complete:
   ```bash
   # Get the run IDs for the latest release
   gh run list -c $(git rev-parse x.y.z)
   # Wait for the run to complete
   gh run watch {CI run id}
   gh run watch {release run id}
   ```
- View and publish the release:
   ```bash
   gh release view x.y.z --web
   ```
- After publishing the release, verify that all required files are attached to the release
