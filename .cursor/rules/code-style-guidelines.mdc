# Code Style Guidelines

Follow these conventions for consistent code:

- Use TypeScript with proper typing throughout
- Avoid `any` types whenever possible
- Follow the conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, refactor:, etc.)
- Create meaningful tests with descriptive it() blocks
- Use descriptive variable names.
- Add comments only for complex logic, non-obvious decisions, or to explain "why" something is done if not immediately clear from the code.
- Avoid comments that merely restate what the code does, or that become outdated quickly (e.g., comments tracking interactive changes during development).
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Use centralized logging via the logger utility
- For testing, prefer inline snapshots where appropriate

See [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md) for additional style guidelines.
